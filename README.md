# zln9021e
## IDEA
zln9021.c is the application the target will execute, for it to work. client.c should also be running. The client can handle multiple computers.
It can "save" computers. Obviously it can't connect to the computer if it's not switched on but if it is, then the client can execute commands on it.
One can also "delete" computers. Deleting a computer wont actually delete it, it will just tell the program to remove itself from the computer.
Connections can't be restored once they're deleted.
## STATUS
Incomplete.
